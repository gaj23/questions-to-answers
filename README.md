- ESlint, to check programming standards

## Reflections

### General
I tried. I did the right things. Reached out for help. Took breaks. Did research. Ate. Exercised. At the date of the submission for this project, I decided that, for my mental health, I needed to stop and go to sleep. I realized I was trying to complete this project rather than trying to learn from this project. 

### Planning
I experienced deer in the headlights the first day of this project. Everything was difficult. Reading the rubric was painful. Things kept getting scrambled. Despite that, I create a four day schedule, the tasks I thought needed to get done each day, what day I had scheduled to speak with a mentor or outside source. I pretaught and research. I am incredibly proud of the time I took to plan and research. This skill will be beneficial for later projects as well.

### Future Iterations & Necessary Debugging
#### Testing
- I am concerned that sad path testing was not considering.
- A test file for game is needed.
#### JavaScript
- A fully fleshed out game file.
- The instantiation of Game.start in index.js to allow for node to run the application
